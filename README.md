# NFS LAN Server Launcher

A very simple console launcher for the server.dll found in Underground 2 and Most Wanted.

## Usage

- Copy server.dll and server.cfg from the game next to NFSLAN binary (NOTE: servers are different between MW and UG2!)

- Launch NFSLAN like this: `nfslan YourServerName` where `YourServerName` should be self-explanatory

## TODO

- Inject custom ports maybe?
